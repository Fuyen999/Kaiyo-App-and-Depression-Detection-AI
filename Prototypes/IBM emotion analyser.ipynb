    "      First of all it started off by me going to go and pick her up at her place. \n",
    "      She got me a card and fun dip. The card she gave me was perfect, and the fun dip, hey who doesnt like fun dip? \n",
    "      Well after that i took her to our first place we were going to go to. \n",
    "      I didnt tell her what we were going to do, but i did tell her where we were going. I wanted it to be a surprise. \n",
    "      We went to Kensington Metropark, to go and feed the birds from out of your hand....\n",

    "      \n",
    "      The third place that we went to was just a place for us to talk...so we went to the Coffee Bean Coffee House in Plymouth. \n",
    "      I think we got there around 5 and we didnt leave till 9:30...we talked about everything. \n",
    "      It was great. Never did we have a pause in conversation....which when you usually talk to someone for 4.5 hours, \n",
    "      there usually are points when you cant think of anything to say...that just didnt happen. \n",
    "      But the day/date wasnt over...  \n",

    "      The fourth and final thing we did was we went to go see the movie \"How to lose a guy in 10 days\". \n",
